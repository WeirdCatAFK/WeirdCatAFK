## 🌟 Some projects

[FlashBack](https://github.com/WeirdCatAFK/Flashback) | *Electron, JavaScript*
A comprehensive study tool currently in development, designed to facilitate knowledge management and long-term retention through structured document creation (still in development, but there's another repository with the proof of concept for the app, currently I am still working things up to make a better interface)

[PinFix for X](https://github.com/WeirdCatAFK/PinFix) | *JavaScript, Browser API*
Developed a browser extension to fix UX interoperability issues between Pinterest and X (Twitter), ensuring correct source URL retention for saved media.

[Artsy](https://weirdcatafk.github.io/artsy/) | *Web Technologies*
A silly little website made in a day focusing on the explaining of a vision concept and how to improve the skill of matching grey tones in order to better hue (value) understanding.

[3D Stereo Reconstruction For Research Project](https://github.com/WeirdCatAFK/Foper-Python) | *Computer Vision for research Project*
A CIICTE (CENTRO DE INVESTIGACIÓN E INNOVACIÓN EN CIENCIAS DE LA COMPUTACIÓN Y TECNOLOGÍA EDUCATIVA) research project where I was lead of the implementation of the code for the 3d Stereo reconstruction implementation of a genetic algorithm
